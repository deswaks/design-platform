# Design Platform
A design platform for single family houses in CLT developed in Unity.

The program has been created as part of a thesis at the Technical University of Denmark, 2020. It is a proof of concept and still contains errors and room for improvement.

# Documentation
Documentation of the design platform can be found <a href="https://raw.githack.com/deswaks/design-platform/master/Docs/html/index.html">here</a>.

# Installation
To run the application: see the section How To Use.
To modify and/or build the application yourself: the repository can be cloned or the whole project downloaded. The cloned or downloaded directories contains everything needed to run or further develop the application using Unity and Microsoft Visual Studio.

# How to use
To run the application, it is necessary to either (1) clone the repository from GitHub and build to using Unity to fit to the used platform (e.g., Windows or Mac OS) or (2) download the already built executable file located in the “bin” folder of the repository. This pre-built file only works for computers running Windows.

# Acknowledgments
This project was realized by Anders Bomann Christensen, Niklas Rosenkilde and Sebastian Dahl Meier with the support of The Technical University of Denmark under supervision of Associate Professor Tim Pat McGinley.

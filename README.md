# Design Platform
A design platform for single family houses in CLT developed in Unity.

The program has been created as part of a thesis at the Technical University of Denmark, 2020. It is a proof of concept and still contains errors and room for improvement.

# Documentation
Documentation of the design platform can be found <a href="https://raw.githack.com/deswaks/design-platform/master/Docs/html/index.html">here</a>.

# Installation
Instructions will be given here when available.

# How to use
To run the application, it is necessary to either (1) clone the repository from GitHub and build to using Unity to fit to the used platform (e.g., Windows or Mac OS) or (2) download the already built executable file located in the “bin” folder of the repository. This pre-built file only works for comput-ers running Windows.
